# Scraping code for gathering image

This is image data URL to use.  
https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/minimalism?select=featured#!#filterName:featured,viewType:masonry

To gather the source images, I wrote a Python script to scrape abstract paintings from WikiArt.org. 

By using scrapy, I have downloaded around 2000 images.
